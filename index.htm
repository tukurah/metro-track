														We will provide carriage only to the Passenger named on the
														Ticket, and you may be required to produce appropriate
														identification to confirm that you are the Passenger named on
														the Ticket. 3.1.2 For the purposes of the Warsaw Convention and
														the Montreal Convention, an e-Ticket Receipt is deemed to serve
														as a passenger ticket for carriage on Arik Air Limited. 3.1.3 A
														Ticket is not transferable. 3.1.4 Some Tickets are sold at
														discounted fares which may be partially or completely
														non-refundable. You should choose the fare best suited to your
														needs. You may also wish to ensure that you have appropriate
														insurance to cover instances where you have to cancel your
														Ticket. 3.1.5 If you have a Ticket of the type described in
														Article 3.1.4 above which is completely unused solely because
														you are prevented from traveling due to Force Majeure, we will
														provide you with a credit for the non-refundable amount of the
														fare for future travel on us, subject to deduction of a
														reasonable administration fee and provided that you promptly
														advise and furnish us with evidence of such Force Majeure. Such
														credit can be used toward purchase of a Ticket for another
														person. 3.1.6 The Ticket is and remains at all times the
														property of the issuing carrier. 3.1.7 Except in the case of an
														Electronic Ticket, you shall not be entitled to be carried on a
														flight unless you present a valid Ticket containing the Flight
														Coupon for that flight and all other unused Flight Coupons as
														well as the Passenger Coupon. In addition, you shall not be
														entitled to be carried if the Ticket presented is mutilated or
														tampered with, or if it has been altered otherwise than by us or
														our Authorized Agent. In the case of an Electronic Ticket, you
														shall not be entitled to be carried on a flight unless you
														provide positive identification and a valid e-Ticket Receipt has
														been duly issued in your name. 3.1.8(a) In case of loss or
														mutilation of a Ticket (or part of it) by you, upon your request
														we will replace such Ticket (or part of it) by issuing a new
														Ticket, provided there is evidence, readily ascertainable at the
														time, that a Ticket valid for the flight(s) in question was duly
														issued and you sign an agreement to reimburse us for the costs
														and losses specified in Article 3.1.8(b) below. 3.1.8(b) We may
														charge a reasonable administrative fee for this service. We may
														also seek reimbursement from you for any costs or losses, up to
														the value of the original ticket, which are necessary and
														reasonably incurred by us or another carrier for misuse of the
														Ticket. However, we will not claim reimbursement from you for
														any such losses which result from our own negligence. 3.1.8(c)
														Where such evidence is not available or you do not sign such an
														agreement, the carrier issuing the new Ticket may require you to
														pay up to the full Ticket price for a replacement Ticket,
														subject to refund if and when the original issuing carrier is
														satisfied that the lost or mutilated Ticket has not been used
														before the expiry of its validity. If, upon finding the original
														Ticket before the expiry of its validity, you surrender it to
														the carrier issuing the new Ticket, the foregoing refund will be
														processed at that time. 3.1.8(d) Any reimbursement agreement
														signed pursuant to Article 3.1.8(a) will be for an amount up to
														the value of the original Ticket unless the replaced Ticket is
														subsequently used or cashed in by you, in which event your
														obligation to reimburse will also include our costs and expenses
														(including legal fees and expenses) of locating/notifying you
														and enforcing the agreement together with a reasonable
														administration fee in the same currency used to purchase the
														Ticket. 3.1.9 A paper Ticket is valuable and you should take
														appropriate measures to safeguard it and ensure it is not lost
														or stolen.</p>

													<p>3.2 Period of validity 3.2.1 Except as otherwise provided on the
														Ticket, in these Conditions of Carriage, or in any applicable
														Tariffs (which may limit the validity of a Ticket, in which case
														the limitation will be shown on the Ticket), a Ticket is valid
														for: 3.2.1.1 One year from the date of issue; or 3.2.1.2 Subject
														to the first travel occurring within one year from the date of
														issue, one year from the date of first travel under the Ticket.
													</p>

													<p>3.2.2 When you are prevented from traveling within the period of
														validity of the Ticket because at the time you request a
														reservation we are unable to confirm a reservation, the validity
														of such Ticket will be extended, or you may be entitled to a
														voluntary refund in accordance with Article 10.3. 3.2.3 If,
														after having commenced your journey, you are prevented from
														traveling within the period of validity of the Ticket by reason
														of unexpected illness, we may decide to extend the period of
														validity of your Ticket until the date when you become fit to
														travel or until our first flight after such date, from the point
														where the journey is resumed, on which space is available in the
														class of service for which the fare has been paid. Such illness
														must be attested to by an official medical certificate
														confirming the facts of the illness and stating when you will be
														fit to continue your journey. When the flight coupons remaining
														in the Ticket, or in the case of an Electronic Ticket, the
														e-Ticket Receipt, involve one or more Stopovers, the validity of
														such Ticket may be extended for not more than three months from
														the certified date on which you will be medically fit to
														continue your journey. In such circumstances, we will similarly
														extend the period of validity of Tickets of other members of
														your immediate family accompanying you. 3.2.4 In the event of
														death of a Passenger en route, the Tickets of persons
														accompanying the Passenger maybe modified by waiving the minimum
														stay or extending the validity. In the event of a death in the
														immediate family of a Passenger who has commenced travel, the
														validity of the Passenger&rsquo;s Ticket and those of his or her
														immediate family who are accompanying the Passenger may likewise
														be modified. Any such modification shall be made upon receipt of
														a valid death certificate and any such extension of validity
														shall not be for a period longer than forty-five (45) days from
														the date of the death. The issuing carrier may charge a
														reasonable administration fee for this service.</p>

													<p>3.3 Coupon sequence and use 3.3.1 The Ticket you have purchased
														is valid only for the transportation shown on the Ticket from
														the place of departure via any Agreed Stopping Places to the
														final destination. The fare you have paid is based upon our
														Tariff and is for the transportation as shown on the Ticket. It
														forms an essential part of our contract with you. The Ticket
														will not be honoured and will lose its validity if all the
														Coupons are not used in the sequence provided in the Ticket.
														3.3.2 Should you wish to change any aspect of your
														transportation you must contact us in advance. The fare for your
														new transportation will be calculated and you will be given the
														option of accepting the new price or maintaining your original
														transportation as ticketed. Should you be required to change any
														aspect of your transportation due to Force Majeure, you must
														contact us as soon as possible and we will use reasonable
														efforts to transport you to your next Stopover or final
														destination, without recalculation of the fare, provided that
														you promptly advise us and furnish evidence of such Force
														Majeure. 3.3.3 Should you change your transportation without our
														agreement your unused Coupons will not be valid for travel until
														we have assessed the correct price for your actual travel and
														you have paid any difference between the price you previously
														paid and the total price applicable for your revised
														transportation. We will refund you the difference if the new
														price is lower but otherwise your unused Coupons will have no
														value. 3.3.4 Please be aware that while some types of changes
														will not result in a change of fare, others, such as changing
														the place of departure (for example if you do not fly the first
														segment) or reversing the direction you travel, can result in an
														increase in price. Many fares are valid only on the dates and
														for the flights shown on the Ticket and may not be changed at
														all, or only upon payment of an additional fee. 3.3.5 Each
														Flight Coupon contained in your Ticket will be accepted for
														transportation in the class of service on the date and flight
														for which space has been reserved. When a Ticket is originally
														issued without a reservation being specified, space may be later
														reserved subject to our Tariff and the availability of space on
														the flight requested. 3.3.6 Please be advised that in the event
														you do not show up for any flight without advising us one (1)
														day in advance of departure of the flight, we may decide to
														cancel your return or onward reservations. However, if you do
														advise us in advance, we will not cancel your subsequent flight
														reservations. Additional penalties may apply if a passenger
														fails to show up for any flight. Please contact us for
														additional information on these penalties and the situations in
														which they are assessed.</p>

													<p>3.4 Name and address of carrier Our name may be abbreviated to
														our Airline Designator Code, or otherwise, in the Ticket. Our
														address shall be deemed to be the airport of departure shown
														opposite the first abbreviation of our name in the
														&ldquo;carrier&rdquo; box in the Ticket, or in the case of an
														Electronic Ticket, as indicated for our first flight segment in
														the e-Ticket Receipt. Article 4 &mdash; Fares, Taxes, Fees,
														Charges and Surcharges 4.1 Fares Fares apply only for carriage
														from the airport at the point of origin to the airport at the
														point of destination, unless otherwise expressly stated. Fares
														do not include ground transport service between airports and
														between airports and town terminals. Your fare will be
														calculated in accordance with our Tariff in effect on the date
														of payment of your Ticket for travel on the specific dates and
														itinerary shown in it. Should you change your itinerary or dates
														of travel, this may affect the fare to be paid.</p>

													<p>4.2 Taxes, fees and charges Applicable taxes, fees and charges
														imposed by government or other authority, by the operator of an
														airport, or by us shall be payable by you. When you purchase
														your Ticket, you will be advised of taxes, fees and charges not
														included in the fare, most of which will normally be shown
														separately on the Ticket. If you have purchased your ticket
														through an Authorized Agent and the Authorized Agent has failed
														to provide details of applicable taxes, fees and charges,
														resulting in no payment, or insufficient payment, of such taxes,
														fees and charges, you must pay the relevant amount at the
														airport before you are entitled to carriage. The taxes, fees and
														charges imposed on air travel are constantly changing and can be
														imposed after the date of purchase or the date of your
														Ticket&rsquo;s issuance. If there is an increase in a tax, fee
														or charge shown on the Ticket, you will be obliged to pay it,
														provided that the additional tax, fee, or charge is imposed by
														government or other authority. Likewise, if a new tax, fee or
														charge is imposed by government or other authority, even after
														payment or the date of issue of your Ticket, you will be obliged
														to pay it. Similarly, in the event any taxes, fees or charges
														which you have paid to us at the time of issue of your Ticket
														are abolished or reduced such that they no longer apply to you,
														or a lesser amount is due, you will be entitled to claim a
														refund if the authorities or entities imposing these taxes,
														charges or fees grant us a corresponding refund.</p>

													<p>4.3 Exceptional circumstances surcharges 4.3.1 In exceptional
														circumstances, charges may be imposed by us which are not taxes,
														fees or charges levied by the government or by a third party
														which are not normally applicable to our operations (for
														example, but not limited to, insurance premium supplements or
														additional security costs triggered by terrorism). In addition,
														we may be subject to significant increases in operational costs,
														such as fuel charges, caused by exceptional circumstances beyond
														our control. Where such charges relate to carriage of
														passengers, we shall (subject to Article 4.3.2) be entitled to
														require you to pay, as fare surcharges, all such charges
														attributable by us to your carriage (even if imposed after the
														date of issue of your Ticket), save that where the total of all
														surcharges payable exceeds the lesser amount of, 25 percent of
														the cost of your Ticket or the sum of $50 USD, (or the
														equivalent amount in the currency used to purchase the ticket),
														you may choose not to pay and receive an involuntary refund in
														accordance with the provisions of Article 10.2. 4.3.2 We will
														endeavor to contact you with details of any applicable fare
														surcharges, as well as any increases in charges, taxes, or fees,
														as soon as possible. If we are unable to contact you, we will
														advise you of the applicable fare surcharge at check-in. You are
														entitled to choose not to pay the fare surcharge and receive an
														involuntary refund in accordance with Article 10.2, in which
														case we will have no further liability to you. 4.3.3 In the
														event any such surcharge you have paid to us at the time of
														issue of your Ticket ceases to apply to you, or a lesser amount
														is due, you will be entitled to claim a refund. Refunds are
														available prior to travel commencing or on partially used
														tickets. Refunds are not available on fully used tickets.
														Refunds will be provided in accordance with Article 10 of these
														Conditions of Carriage.</p>

													<p>4.4 Currency Fares, taxes, fees and charges are payable in the
														currency of the country in which the Ticket is issued, unless
														another currency is indicated by us or our Authorized Agent, at
														or before the time payment is made (for example, because of the
														non-convertibility of the local currency). At our discretion, we
														may accept payment in another currency. Article 5 &mdash;
														Reservations 5.1 Reservation requirements 5.1.1 We or our
														Authorized Agent will record your reservation(s). Upon request
														we will provide you with written confirmation of your
														reservation(s). 5.1.2 Certain fares have conditions which limit
														or exclude your right to change or cancel reservations. 5.1.3 If
														you have a medical condition or other condition for which you
														may require medical assistance or special assistance during
														embarkation, disembarkation or assistance during the flight (for
														example, in the circumstances set out at Articles 7.3 and 7.4),
														you must advise us at the time you make your booking. You will
														be given a provisional booking until such time that we are
														satisfied that you have received medical clearance required by
														Article 7.3 and satisfied all conditions attached to such
														clearance. If you are flying to or from the United States, you
														do not need to comply with the requirements set out in this
														Article 5.1.3 and you should ask us how the requirements differ.

														not suitable for carriage in the cargo compartment (such as
														delicate musical instruments), and which do not meet the

													<p>9.2 Cancellation, re-routing, delays, etc. 9.2.1 Departure and
														flight times are not guaranteed. For operational reasons or

														carrying you and your Baggage. In the exercise of these measures
														and in order to prevent a flight cancellation, at our discretion
														we may arrange for a flight to be operated on our behalf by an
														alternative carrier and/or aircraft. 9.2.2 If we cancel a flight
														due to be operated by us, fail to operate a flight reasonably
														according to the schedule, fail to stop at your destination or
														Stopover destination, or cause you to miss a connecting flight
														operated by us in circumstances where you hold a confirmed
														reservation and more than adequate time existed to make the
														connection between the originally scheduled time of arrival of
														your flight at the airport and the departure time of the
														connecting flight at the same airport, we shall, at your option,
														either: 9.2.2.1 Carry you and your Baggage at the earliest
														opportunity on another of our flights on which space is
														available without additional charge and, where necessary, extend

														shown on your Ticket by our own services or those of another
														carrier, or by other mutually agreed means and class of
														transportation without additional charge. If the fare and
														charges for the revised routing are lower than what you have
														paid, we shall refund the difference; or 9.2.2.3 Make an
														involuntary refund in accordance with the provisions of Article
														10.2. 9.2.3 Upon the occurrence of any of the events set out in
														Article 9.2.2, except as otherwise provided by the Warsaw
														Convention or the Montreal Convention (as applicable), the
														options outlined in Article 9.2.2.1 through 9.2.2.3 are the sole
														and exclusive remedies available to you and we shall have no
														further liability to you. 9.2.4 Where your flight is due to be
														operated by us from an airport within the EU and has been
														cancelled or delayed for at least two hours you may be entitled
														to certain rights and you should ask us about those rights,
														where relevant.</p>

													<p>9.3 Denied Boarding 9.3.1 If overbooking of a flight operated by
														us means we are unable to carry you even though you hold a valid
														Ticket for the flight with a Confirmed Reservation and you have
														presented yourself for check-in within the time limit specified
														in Article 6, we shall compensate you according to, and to the
														extent required by applicable law and our denied boarding
														policy, and where relevant you should ask us about your rights.
													</p>

													<p>9.3.5 Denied Boarding compensation will not be paid by us if:
														9.3.5.1 Carriage has been denied for reasons beyond our control;
														or 9.3.5.2 You have refused to undergo a security check or obey
														lawful instructions given to you by us or on our behalf; or
														9.3.5.3 There are any other circumstances which entitle us to
														refuse to carry you, including, but not limited to applicable
														law or application of these Conditions of Carriage; or 9.3.5.4
														You are traveling free; or 9.3.5.5 You are traveling on a
														charter flight; or 9.3.5.6 You present yourself with a lost,
														stolen, fraudulent or otherwise suspicious ticket. 9.3.6
														Acceptance of the denied boarding compensation relieves us from
														any further liability in connection with the Denied Boarding.
														9.3.7 Where you are denied boarding from a flight operated by us
														from an airport within the EU, in circumstances where you hold a
														Confirmed Reservation, have met the applicable check-in deadline
														and are not precluded from boarding by reason of application of

														Carriage or for other reasonable grounds, and are not traveling
														free of charge or on a reduced fare not generally available to
														the public, you may be entitled to compensation and you should
														ask us about those rights, where relevant. Article 10 &mdash;

														presentation of satisfactory proof of such payment. 10.1.2 If a

													<p>10.2 Involuntary refunds 10.2.1 If we cancel a flight, fail to
														operate a flight reasonably according to schedule, fail to stop
														at your destination or Stopover, or cause you to miss a
														connecting flight in circumstances where you hold a Confirmed

														refuse you carriage for any of the reasons set out in Article

														actual flight for which you were refused carriage. Apart from
														this, we will have no liability to you for any loss or expense
														whatsoever. 10.2.3 If your carriage is prematurely terminated by
														us pursuant to Article 11.4 because of your breach of duty in
														relation to your conduct aboard an aircraft, the amount of your
														refund will be calculated according to Article 10.2.1 except

														which your breach of duty occurred. Additionally, we shall be
														entitled to deduct from any refund due to you an administration
														fee as well as any costs due for reimbursement by you under
														Article 11.4.4.</p>

														expenses) of locating/notifying you and enforcing the agreement
														together with a reasonable administration fee. 10.4.2 If we or
														our Authorised Agent lose the Ticket or portion of it, the loss

														11.2).</p>

														manner and the same currency used to pay for the Ticket.</p>

														result that alcohol purchased by passengers (whether as duty
														free purchases at airports or aboard aircraft or other
														purchases) cannot be consumed aboard our aircraft.</p>

													<p>11.3 Smoking policy Smoking is not permitted on any of our
														flights.</p>

													<p>11.4 Breach of duty If, in our reasonable opinion, you fail
														wholly or partially to observe any of the duties placed on you
														by Articles 11.1 to 11.3: 11.4.1 We may report the matter to any

														may take such measures as we consider necessary to prevent the
														continuation or repetition of such conduct including, but not
														limited to, physical restraint and/or removal of you from the
														aircraft and/or refusal to carry you after a Stopover (whether
														made for the purpose of removing you from the aircraft or
														otherwise); and 11.4.3 We may decide to refuse to carry you at
														any time in the future; and 11.4.4 You will reimburse us any
														costs we incur in order to (a) repair or replace property lost,
														damaged or destroyed by you; (b) compensate any passenger or
														crew member affected by your actions; and (c) divert the
														aircraft for the purpose of removing you from the aircraft. We
														may apply the value of any unused portion of your Ticket or any
														of your funds in our possession against such payment or
														expenses. Article 12 &mdash; Arrangements for Additional
														Services 12.1 If we make arrangements for you with any third
														party to provide any services other than scheduled carriage by
														air, or if we issue a ticket or voucher relating to
														transportation or services (including non-scheduled carriage by
														air) provided by a third party, in doing so we act only as your
														agent. The terms and conditions of the third party service
														provider will apply and we shall have no liability to you in
														respect of any claims arising out of our making of such
														arrangements.</p>

													<p>12.2 If we are also providing other surface transportation to
														you, other conditions may apply to such surface transportation.
														Such conditions are available from us upon request. Article 13
														&mdash; Administrative Formalities 13.1 General 13.1.1 You are
														responsible for obtaining all required passports, travel
														documents, visas, health certificates and for complying with all
														laws, regulations, orders, demands and travel requirements of

														requirements, rules or instructions.</p>

													<p>13.2 Travel documents Prior to travel, you must present all exit,
														entry, health and other documents required by law, regulation,
														order, demand or other requirement of the countries concerned,
														and permit us to take and retain copies thereof. We reserve the
														right to require you to present to us any of these documents at
														any time during your carriage and to refuse carriage if you fail
														to produce them on request, you fail to comply with these
														requirements, or your travel documents do not appear to be in
														order.</p>

													<p>13.3 Refusal of entry If you are denied entry into any country,
														including a country through which you are transiting en route to
														your final destination, you will be responsible to pay any fine
														or charge assessed against us by the government concerned and
														for the cost of transporting you from that country. In such
														circumstances, the fare collected for carriage to the point of
														refusal or denied entry will not be refunded by us.</p>

													<p>13.4 Passenger responsible for fines, detention costs, etc. If we
														are required to pay any fine or penalty or detention,
														deportation or escorting costs, or to incur any expenditure
														(including the cost of issuing you with a ticket(s) in
														connection with your deportation or rerouting) by reason of your
														failure to comply with laws, regulations, orders, demands or
														other travel requirements of the countries concerned or to
														produce the required documents, you shall reimburse us on
														demand, any amount so paid or expenditure so incurred. We may
														apply towards such payment or expenditure the value of any
														unused carriage on your ticket, or any of your funds in our
														possession.</p>

													<p>13.5 Customs inspection If required, you shall attend any
														inspection of your Baggage by customs or other government
														officials. We are not liable to you for any loss or damage
														suffered by you in the course of such inspection or through your
														failure to comply with this requirement.</p>

													<p>13.6 Security inspection You shall submit to any security checks
														by governments, airport officials, carriers or by us. Article 14
														&mdash; Successive Carriers Carriage to be performed by us and
														other carriers in succession under one Ticket, or a Conjunction
														Ticket, is likely to be regarded as a single operation for the
														purposes of the Warsaw Convention and the Montreal Convention,
														but please note the restrictions laid down in Article 15.2 in
														relation to our liability for such carriage. Article 15 &mdash;
														Liability for Damage 15.1 Applicable law The liability of each
														carrier involved in your journey will be determined by
														applicable law and the carrier's Conditions of Carriage.
														Applicable law may comprise the Warsaw Convention or the
														Montreal Convention and/or local law in individual countries.
														The Warsaw Convention and the Montreal Convention apply to
														international carriage/transportation, as defined in those
														Conventions. Provisions concerning our liability are set out in
														Articles 15.2 to 15.7.</p>

													<p>15.2 Scope of liability We will be liable only for Damage
														occurring during carriage on flights or flight segments operated
														by us or in relation to which we have a legal liability to you.
														If we issue a Ticket or if we check Baggage for carriage on
														another carrier, we do so only as agent for the other carrier.
														Where transportation of your Baggage is performed by successive
														carriers (as defined by the Warsaw Convention or the Montreal
														Convention, as applicable), you may make a claim against the
														first or last carrier.</p>

													<p>15.3 General Limitations 15.3.1 Wherever the Warsaw Convention or
														the Montreal Convention applies to your carriage, our liability
														will be subject to the rules and limitations of the applicable
														Convention. 15.3.2 We will be wholly or partly exonerated from
														liability if the Damage was caused or contributed to by your
														negligence, wrongful act or omission, or the negligence of the
														person from whom you derive your rights or, if different, the
														person suffering the Damage. 15.3.3 We may be wholly or partly
														exonerated from liability to you for Damage if we prove that the
														Damage did not result from our negligence, or that it resulted
														from the negligence of a third party, or that we took certain
														measures to avoid the Damage or that it was impossible to take
														such measures. 15.3.4 Except to the extent inconsistent with the
														Warsaw Convention or the Montreal Convention, we are not liable
														for any Damage arising from our compliance with applicable laws
														or government rules and regulations, or from your failure to
														comply with the same. 15.3.5 In some circumstances, we may be
														wholly or partly exonerated from liability if the Damage did not
														result from our negligence or, alternatively, resulted from the
														negligence of a third party. 15.3.6 Except where other specific
														provision is made in these Conditions of Carriage, we shall be
														liable to you only for recoverable compensatory damages for
														proven losses and costs in accordance with the Warsaw Convention
														or the Montreal Convention or local laws, as applicable. 15.3.7
														The contract of carriage, including these Conditions of Carriage
														and all applicable exclusions and limits of liability, applies
														for the benefit of our Authorised Agents, servants, employees
														and representatives to the same extent as they apply to us. The
														total amount recoverable from us and from such Authorised
														Agents, employees, representatives and persons shall not exceed
														the amount of our own liability, if any. 15.3.8 Nothing in these
														Conditions of Carriage: 15.3.8.1 Gives up or waives any
														exclusion or limitation of our liability under the Warsaw
														Convention or the Montreal Convention applicable laws unless
														otherwise expressly stated by us in writing; or 15.3.8.2
														Prevents us from excluding or limiting our liability under the
														Warsaw Convention or the Montreal Convention or any laws which
														apply or gives up any defence available to us thereunder against
														any public social security body or any person liable to pay, or
														who has paid, compensation for the death, wounding or other
														bodily injury of a Passenger.</p>

													<p>15.4 Death or injury of passengers In the event of death,
														wounding or other bodily injury suffered by a passenger as a
														result of an accident covered by the Warsaw Convention or the
														Montreal Convention: 15.4.1 Our liability for proven damages
														shall not be subject to any financial limit, be it defined by
														law, the Warsaw Convention or otherwise; 15.4.2 We will not be
														liable for damages in excess of 113,100 Special Drawing Rights
														per Passenger where we can prove that the Damage was not due to
														the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of us or our
														servants or agents; or such Damage was solely due to the
														negligence or other wrongful act or omission of a third party.
														15.4.3 We agree to make advance payments, subject to the
														following conditions, namely: 15.4.3.1 The person receiving
														payment is a natural person; 15.4.3.2 You are, or the person
														receiving payment is, entitled to compensation under applicable
														laws; 15.4.3.3 Payments will be made only in respect of
														immediate economic needs; 15.4.3.4 The amount of a payment will
														be proportional to the economic hardship being suffered as a
														result of the death, wounding or bodily injury, save that, in
														the case of death, it will not be less than the national
														currency equivalent of 16,000 SDRs per Passenger; 15.4.3.5
														Payment will not be made later than 15 days after the identity
														of the person entitled to compensation has been established
														under applicable laws; 15.4.3.6 No person will be entitled to
														receive a payment if he or she, or the Passenger to whom the
														payment relates, caused or contributed to the Damage to which
														the payment relates by his or her negligence; 15.4.3.7 All
														payments will be made subject to the condition that they will be
														returned to us on proof that the recipient has ceased to be able
														to comply at all times with Article 15.4.3.2 or he or she or the
														Passenger to whom the payment relates, caused or contributed to
														the Damage to which the payment relates; 15.4.3.8 Payments will
														be off-set against any subsequent sums payable in respect of our
														liability under applicable laws; 15.4.3.9 Except for payment of
														the minimum sum specified in Article 15.4.3.4 in respect of
														death, a payment will not exceed the maximum damages for which
														we may be liable to pay the recipient; 15.4.3.10 The making of a
														payment will not constitute recognition or admission of
														liability by us; 15.4.3.11 No payment will be made unless the
														person receiving payment gives us a signed receipt which also
														acknowledges the applicability of Articles 15.4.3.7, 15.4.3.8
														and 15.4.3.10; and 15.4.3.12 Save to the extent in conflict with
														any applicable law, and subject to payment of the minimum sum
														specified in Article 15.4.3.4 in the case of death, our decision
														in relation to the payment amount will be final and binding.</p>

													<p>15.5 Baggage 15.5.1 We will not be liable for damage to unchecked
														baggage unless such damage is caused by our negligence. 15.5.2.
														Except as provided in Article 15.5.3, our maximum liability is
														limited to the national currency equivalent 332 SDRs (as
														determined by applicable law) per passenger for unchecked
														baggage and the national currency equivalent of 17 SDRs per
														kilogram (as determined by applicable law) for checked baggage
														where the Warsaw Convention applies, and to a maximum of the
														national currency equivalent of 1,131 SDRs per passenger for
														unchecked and checked baggage where the Montreal Convention
														applies. The limits of liability for damage to unchecked and
														checked baggage laid down by local law apply to your Baggage
														where your carriage does not form part of international carriage
														for the purposes of the Warsaw Convention or the Montreal
														Convention. Neither will we accept liability for cosmetic and/or
														superficial damage caused to baggage as a result of normal wear
														and tear during the course of carriage. All claims made under
														the Montreal Convention must be substantiated by documented
														proof of purchase, including date and price of purchase.
														Depreciation will be deducted. 15.5.3 The maximum limits of
														liability stated in Article 15.5.2 shall not apply if; (i) the
														Damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier done with
														intent to cause Damage or recklessly and with knowledge that
														Damage would probably result; or (ii) in the case of Checked
														Baggage, a higher value is declared in writing at the time it
														was handed to the carrier and an additional charge is paid to
														the carrier pursuant to an excess valuation facility as
														determined by the carrier. 15.5.4 Where an additional charge is
														paid pursuant to an excess valuation facility for Checked
														Baggage under Article 15.5.3, we will be liable for any Damage
														to this item up to the higher amount declared. 15.5.5 Where
														applicable law provides that different limits of liability are
														applicable to Unchecked Baggage and/or Checked Baggage, such
														different limits shall apply. 15.5.6 If the weight of the
														Baggage is not recorded on the Baggage Check, it is presumed for
														all purposes that the total weight of the Checked Baggage does
														not exceed the applicable free baggage allowance for the class
														of carriage applicable to the Passenger's booking. 15.5.7 Except
														to the extent inconsistent with the Warsaw Convention or the
														Montreal Convention (where applicable), we shall have no
														liability whatsoever for Damage to articles not permitted to be
														contained in Checked Baggage under Article 8.3, or carried as
														Unchecked Baggage including but not limited to fragile or
														perishable items, valuable items (including, but not limited to,
														money, jewelry, precious metals, computers, personal electronic
														devices), any medication or medical equipment which may be
														required in-flight or during your trip or which cannot be
														swiftly replaced if lost or damaged, house or car keys, valuable
														documents (including, but not limited to, business documents,
														passports and other identification documents, negotiable papers,
														securities, deeds), or samples. 15.5.8 We will not be liable for
														cosmetic and/or superficial damage caused to Baggage as a result
														of normal wear and tear during the course of any of the
														operations of carriage. 15.5.9 We shall have no liability where
														the Damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or vice of
														the Baggage. Likewise, we will not be liable for fair wear and
														tear of Baggage resulting from the usual and normal rigours of
														transportation by air (see also Article 8.6.4 regarding the
														suitability of your Baggage for transportation by air). 15.5.10
														Where your Baggage has a greater value than the limit of our
														liability stated in Article 15.5.2, you should bring that fact
														to our attention at check-in so that you may make a special
														declaration and pay a supplementary sum according to Article
														15.5.3 or fully insure the value of the Baggage prior to travel.
														In any event, any portion of the value of your Baggage above our
														applicable limit of liability should be insured by you prior to
														travel.</p>

													<p>15.6 Passenger delays Our liability for Damage caused by delay to
														your carriage by air is limited by the Warsaw Convention or the
														Montreal Convention. Where neither of those Conventions applies,
														we will have no liability to you except as provided in these
														Conditions of Carriage. Article 16 - Time Limits for Baggage
														Claims, Processing of Baggage Claims and All Actions for Damages
														16.1 Notice of claims Acceptance of Baggage by the bearer of the
														Baggage Check without complaint at the time of delivery is
														sufficient evidence that the Baggage has been delivered in good
														condition and in accordance with the contract of carriage,
														unless you prove otherwise. If you wish to file a claim or an
														action regarding Damage to Checked Baggage, you must notify us
														as soon as you discover the Damage, and at the latest, within
														seven (7) days of receipt of the Baggage. If you wish to file a
														claim or an action regarding delay of Checked Baggage, you must
														notify us within twenty one (21) days from the date the Baggage
														has been placed at your disposal. Every such notification must
														be made in writing. Where the checked baggage is not placed at
														your disposal at the expiration of 21 days after the date it
														ought to have arrived, you may make a claim.</p>

													<p>16.2 Processing of Baggage claims 16.2.1 All claims for
														compensation for Damage to Baggage must be accompanied by an
														itemised list identifying each affected item by description,
														manufacturer and age, together with proof of purchase or
														ownership for all such items. Proof of purchase will not be
														required in relation to any item which costs less than $5 USD
														(or local currency equivalent), or is more than five (5) years
														old and has a claims value of less than $50 USD (or local
														currency equivalent). Depreciation will be deducted from claims,
														where we consider appropriate. 16.2.2 In the case of a
														compensation claim concerning physical damage to Baggage, you
														must retain and, if requested by us, let us examine the affected
														Baggage so that we may assess the nature, extent and
														reparability of that damage. 16.2.3 If you wish to claim the
														cost of replacement of an individual item which forms part of a
														claim for compensation for Damage to Baggage, you must consult
														us before you incur such cost otherwise we may not include the
														cost in any compensation payable. This requirement will not
														apply where the total cost of replacement items does not exceed
														$50 USD (or local currency equivalent). Proof of purchase of all
														replacement items must accompany your claim. Proof of purchase
														will not be required in relation to any item which costs less
														than $5 USD (or local currency equivalent). 16.2.4 For all
														claims for compensation concerning Baggage, you must provide us
														with any information we may request to assess the eligibility of
														your claim for compensation and the amount of any compensation
														payable. 16.2.5 If required by us, you will sign a statement of
														truth regarding the facts of your claim for Damage to Baggage
														before we pay any compensation to you. 16.2.6 Failure by you to
														fully comply with the relevant requirements of Article 16.2 may
														adversely affect the amount of any compensation to which you may
														be entitled.</p>

													<p>16.3 Limitation of actions Any right to Damages shall be
														extinguished if an action is not brought within two (2) years of
														the date of arrival at destination, or the date on which the
														aircraft was scheduled to arrive, or the date on which the
														carriage stopped. The method of calculating the period of
														limitation shall be determined by the law of the court where the
														case is heard. Article 17 &mdash; Other Conditions Carriage of
														you and your Baggage is also provided in accordance with certain
														other regulations and conditions applying to or adopted by us.
														These regulations and conditions are varied from time to time
														and are important. They concern among other things: the carriage
														of unaccompanied minors, pregnant women and sick passengers,
														restrictions on use of electronic devices and items, the on
														board consumption of alcoholic beverages, security, forbidden
														items in Baggage, limits on size and weight of Baggage, Baggage
														Fees, Customer Service Policies, and airport operational
														policies.</p>

													<p>Regulations and conditions concerning these matters are available
														from us upon request. Article 18 - Interpretation 18.1 Our
														interpretation of applicable government laws, regulations, or
														orders in relation to Articles 7.1.1 (right to refuse carriage)
														and 11.1.1 (conduct aboard aircraft) shall be final and binding
														even if it subsequently proves incorrect provided that at all
														material times we had no reasonable grounds for believing
														otherwise.</p>

													<p>18.2 The title of each Article of these Conditions of Carriage is
														for convenience only, and is not to be used for interpretation
														of the text. </p>.
